### 42 Cursus Project 9

**Score: 125/125**

In this project, we created a game inspired by [Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D).</br>
The program reads from a map and displays a maze with a dynamic view using an [algorithm](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) by Lode Vandevenne.</br>
For bonus, we implemented an animated torch with lighting, mouse control, wall collisions, minimap and doors.
